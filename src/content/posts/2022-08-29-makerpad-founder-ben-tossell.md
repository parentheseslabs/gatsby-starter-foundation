Ben Tossel is the founder and CEO of Makerpad - #1 no-code educational community. He raised a seed round from Earnest Capital, Andrew Wilkinson, Sahil Lavingia, Ross Mason, and others. In 2021, Zapier acquired Makerpad and he continues to run the company from within Zapier.

Initially, Ben developed a website where he uploaded screencast tutorials and charged individuals for access to them. He advertised it on his email list and drew some early buyers. He persisted in pressing for greater features and capabilities and developed Makerpad, a Webflow site dedicated to teaching people how to utilise no-code technologies. Makerpad has earned over $200,000 in sales in less than a year - all while Ben was employed as Earnest Capital's head of platform. 

What does Makerpad do?
Makerpad is the world's largest educational resource for creating internet enterprises, software, and apps without coding. Makerpad is built entirely using no-code tools — mainly Webflow, Zapier, Circle, Memberstack, Stripe, ConvertKit, Notion and Slack and makerpad features all of these. On top of that, there are several levels of community,boot camps and other things like that. The primary consumer for Makerpad have been creators, people who want to be entrepreneurs and launch their ideas. There is also a lot of B2B interest. Startups are also assisted in automating processes and empowering their teams to develop their own solutions at Makerpad. 

A success story worth mentioning
A former solar panel salesperson was able to develop a successful no-code firm that has subsequently risen to seven figures thanks to no-code! When his solar boss told him about a weird software concept he had that would assist their firm with marketing — and may possibly benefit other local businesses like theirs as well., he decided to use Bubble to develop he idea. Within two months he  learnt Bubble and made a business (named Revetize). Bubble.io and Zapier are the major components of their solution, but they also leveraged services like Plivo and Mailgun. Within a year, they had developed a client base that paid roughly $300,000 each month. They were accepted into the AngelPad tech accelerator programme and were on their way to New York City to learn how to take their business to the next level.


Ben Tossell’s definition of No-Code
Ben Tossell does not like the term "no-code." Because he believes that you're still copying and pasting code bits at times. No-code, in Ben Tossel’s opinion, is about building things that formerly required someone with technical skills but no longer do.

How does No-code affect businesses?
An organisation would require a developer that is knowledgeable with programming codes to produce software or an application; however, startups and many smaller organisations typically do not have a technical team with developers and do not have the funds to hire or create one for their organisation. For such firms no-code tools might be advantageous since it enables quick access.
No-code tools are  created with non-coders and non-developers in mind, with companies able to construct their apps using the plug and play concept of the no-code tools. Such tools are useful for folks who are unfamiliar with CSS, HTML, or JS. Security vulnerability screening, testing, integrations, hosting, disaster recovery, analytics, and other non-technical jobs are also included in the no-code tasks required for building applications.
Most businesses have a booking system or something similar that can be automated. No-code will allow you to perform things much more quickly, saving you time on repeated tasks.
Companies waste a lot of time doing things like transferring data from one spreadsheet to another. No-code just replaces the uninteresting aspects of people's employment, allowing them to focus on the bigger, better elements of their professions, strategy, and everything else.
No-code would restructure the developing business.They can no longer charge $100,000 to design an app as they do now. Hopefully, these costs will level off and people will not be forced to spend their life savings on something that may or may not function.
For freelancers, we can now provide automation services, or we can now, say, not just design your website, but also develop a working website with Webflow and other tools. In the consulting sector, it will be another tool that individuals will add to their repertoire and utilise to their advantage. So it'll be fascinating to watch how we educate individuals as well as these corporations, especially because it's so simple to do it yourself.
