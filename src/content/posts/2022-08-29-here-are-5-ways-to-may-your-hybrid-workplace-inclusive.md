You're back in office after almost 2 years. Confused? Here are 5 ways to make your hybrid workplace inclusive

COVID-19 has compelled workplaces to reconfigure their who, what, where, when, and how of collaboration. And, as we know restructuring events can either worsen or mitigate inequity. It is time for another crucial intervention — flexible and hybrid work – to improve employee well-being.

1. Extend your understanding of flexibility.
Four-day workweeks, work-from-home Wednesdays, and other similar programmes provide some flexibility, but they still exclude some people. Rigid flexibility remains rigid and does not apply to every employee's daily life. Allow your employees to choose when and where they work, and you will be rewarded with increased employee loyalty and productivity. For example, Airbnb enables its workers to live and work practicallyEmployees will still need to meet in person for regular team meetings and activities. Salaries will not change if employees choose to relocate. anywhere in the globe, fully adopting a remote work policy to attract and retain employees.

Companies can lead with inclusive tools and behaviours that enable new ways for workers to be productive, connected, and collaborative from anywhere, especially on days when people are in the office, as they continue to build hybrid work schedules.

2. Spend money on remote-forward advocates.
Working remotely might provide several challenges if you are not deliberate about it. Spend as much time and effort developing an online office environment as you would an on-site office location. Don't just toss your staff into the mix, either. New technological tools may appear to be a productivity blessing, but they may not work for everyone. If you allow your employees to choose when and where they work, you will be rewarded with employee loyalty and increased production.

A great practise is to designate one person from each department as the point person for remote tools. Make certain that your self-managed team is diverse and really reflects all employees. They are trained and then provide feedback on how to improve the product and the entire online experience.

3. Teach managers how to manage in a hybrid environment.
When workers work various hours in different places, being a people manager becomes more difficult. In the hybrid age, managers should focus on driving purpose and relationships across virtual teams.

In a mixed work setting, managers must focus on three key behaviours:

Take the time to learn why your staff like the hours/locations they do. Maybe they wish to work from home on Fridays so they can go to the masjid for afternoon prayers, or maybe they need physical treatment in the mornings for a chronic disease. The more you understand about your employees' motivations, the more you will be able to help them.
Communicate openly and honestly with your direct reports. Hearing diverse signals from different sections of the business was the most generally identified difficulty among employees in an MIT poll. Having a consistent message will make employees feel more connected, no matter where they are.
Give staff autonomy while being supportive. Employees in a flexible hybrid work environment should feel comfortable determining when and how they work, as well as making work-related decisions on their own.
They should, however, feel comfortable discussing their concerns and asking their bosses for assistance when necessary. Managers that show empathy (again, by knowing why their people do what they do) will be better positioned to strike that balance.

4. Create collaboration equity.
Maintaining virtual connections will become increasingly vital as more firms embrace hybrid work in the long run. In a hybrid workplace, it is critical that teams create collaboration equity by providing all employees with the tools, access, and information they require to collaborate with their teams and be effective at their tasks. Here are a few ideas you can start using right away.

Request feedback from people who are not present. Try starting a meeting by asking opinion from those who are not in the room, so they feel invited to contribute from the start.
During talks, use interactive technologies to increase inclusion. Workplace tools can help to bring colleagues together. 
Make meetings as easy to attend as possible. Promoting accessibility and respecting colleagues' professional and personal schedules is what collaboration equity entails. This might imply offering everyone the option of asynchronous meetings, which can be recorded and viewed by employees in various time zones or with atypical work patterns when their schedule allows. 

5. Use technology the right way.
Opening the virtual office door is one solution. Previously, an open physical door indicated that you may step in and converse with your colleague. People may be hesitant to contact a colleague if there are no apparent indicators of how busy they are. Make advantage of the status bar when working remotely. A statement such as "Open for talks!" accompanied by a green status circle grants authorization to cross the distance gap. Companies may also use virtual reality and virtual conference rooms to generate a sense of belonging and sharing. The virtual meeting technology market is expanding, providing companies with more and more alternatives for bringing these rooms to life.
No-Code tools can be used to design customised apps for the teams to ensure smooth functioning and ease of use. A No-Code tool is a piece of software that enables non-technical people to create their own software or apps, typically with a visual interface, a location to store data, and the capacity to make logical judgments.
