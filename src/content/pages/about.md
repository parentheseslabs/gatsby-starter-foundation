Did you know that only 0.3% of people can build software? Sadly it is the truth.
Imagine working professionals like doctors, coaches, lawyers, and salespeople built their software! Think of all the ideas and solutions we’re missing because it’s been inaccessible to develop software.

We started Prativa with the single goal of imparting the right skillset and tools in aspiring no-code developers and designers. We are on a mission to develop a million talents by 2047. Join us in this no-code movement.
